# EmojiWave â€“ Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition with Emoji Feedback

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**EmojiWave** is a web application that uses computer vision to detect hand gestures in real-time. It then translates these gestures into corresponding emojis using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The app leverages **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience, enabling users to either upload an image or use their webcam for real-time gesture recognition.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Real-time emoji feedback:** Detects hand gestures via webcam or uploaded images and displays corresponding emojis.
- **Interactive experience:** Fun and personal interaction without the need for touch or voice inputs.
- **Portable deployment:** Easily deployed via Docker for seamless use across different environments.
- **Live Demo:** Try the app in action at [EmojiWave - Live Demo](https://emojiwaveapp.streamlit.app/)

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow** (for deep learning)
- **OpenCV** (for computer vision)
- **Streamlit** (for interactive web interface)
- **Jupyter / Google Colab** (for model development)
- **Docker** (for containerized deployment)
- **VS Code** (for development)

## ðŸ“¸ How It Works
1. **Upload an image** or use your **webcam** for gesture recognition.
2. The system processes the image or video stream, detecting hand gestures.
3. The recognized gesture is matched to an emoji and displayed on the screen.

## ðŸ’» How to Run the Project Locally

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moalb08/EmojiWave.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd EmojiWave
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the app using Streamlit:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
   ```
